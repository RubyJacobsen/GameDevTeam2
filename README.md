(multiple people can do the same thing)

Overview: People suggested an open-world game or a platformer.

Genre: People suggested open world or platformer, another suggested it be space-themed. New idea, we could do a roguelike, those are pretty fun too

We can start creating images and assets for the game, them being prototypes. Just to get the ball rolling.

I say yes, start creating assets and images. Who wants to start doing it?
